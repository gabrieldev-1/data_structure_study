# ðŸ“š Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to my learning log! This repository is where I document my journey into learning **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

My goal is to track my progress, share solved exercises, notes, and practical examples that help me solidify my knowledge and understand how these fundamental tools are applied in the world of programming.

### Repository Contents

Here you will find content organized by data structure type, including:
- **Notes:** Theoretical summaries on how each structure works.
- **Code Examples:** Basic implementations in [programming language, e.g., Python, JavaScript, Java].
- **Exercises:** Problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or practical exercises I've developed myself.

### Data Structures Covered

This is the roadmap for my learning. Structures marked with âœ… already have content, while the others are next on my list to study.

- [ ] Arrays
- [ ] Linked Lists
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Hash Tables
- [ ] Trees
- [ ] Graphs
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] ...and more!

### How to Navigate

Feel free to explore the folders. Each one is dedicated to a specific data structure. For example, the `Stacks` folder will contain my files on that topic.

### Contact

If you have any suggestions, find any errors, or just want to chat about the topic, feel free to open an *issue* or contact me on [LinkedIn](LINK_TO_YOUR_LINKEDIN).
